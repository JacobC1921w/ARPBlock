## ARPBlock

This is a tool that will allow you to intercept ARP requests from someone on your network, effectively blocking their connection.

### <b>WARNING:</b>
This tool is <i>very</i> noisy, and can be seen very easily. I'm trying to research whether there is a way to scan every single port of the host stealthily, but so far, to no prevail.
