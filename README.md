# 90sHackingSuite

This is a project I have started out of complete boredom. I am to bring you, the user, an experience similar to that of a 90s hacking movie, however it actually works.

I will be making my own tools, and uploading them to this account, for your personal enjoyment.

I start you off with:
## H0stD0sser (ARP blocking)

This is a tool that will allow you to intercept ARP requests from someone on your network, effectively blocking their connection.

### <b>WARNING:</b>
This tool is <i>very</i> noisy, and can be seen very easily. I'm trying to research whether there is a way to scan every single port of the host stealthily, but so far, to no prevail.
